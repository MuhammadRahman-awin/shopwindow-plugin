This plugin allows you to import your Affiliate Window Datafeed and sell the products from any widget area.

== Description ==
If you are a publisher of Affiliate window, who doesn't have the resource, time or technicality to implement Datafeed importing functionality and missing out monetising fromm it then here is the solution for your concern.
All you need is to import the plugin from the setting page and you will have nice widgets and shortcodes ready for action. Sell your affiliate product and monetize from it now.

= What is Datafeed ? =
Read a great detail about Datafeed in here, http://wiki.affiliatewindow.com/index.php/Downloading_A_Feed. You will need to be a publisher to access this page.
The Datafeed tool allows you to put together a datafeed based on a variety of criteria:

    - Category, Advertisers map the categories in their feeds to our category tree. The category tree can be expanded and you can drill down to the lower levels of our tree. Besides each category, you will see the count of products available to download.

    - Advertiser, When you select Advertiser you can chose from a selection of your joined advertisers (as well as open advertisers).

    - Brand, Filtering by Brand allows you to search for a particular brand and only download products that have that brand associated with them.

The next stage is to determine how you would like to download the datafeed. You can toggle the columns required although certain ones are permanently included. Please note that not all fields may be in use by the advertiser.

= How do I use it? =
When you have chosen the columns you are downloading and are happy with the order then you can choose your file format, delimiter and compression type. There is also the option to include adult content, if unchecked then certain adult categories will be removed from the feed.
To access the feed you can download directly from the interface or you can use the generated URL to access that feed in that specified structure at any time. You can create as many of these URLs as you like.

But for this plugin you need to download the feed directly as a csv format and then import it.

= What pre-requisites are there for using this service? =
You have to be registered as a publisher on the Affiliate Window platform. Sign up is a simple process which you can do here - https://darwin.affiliatewindow.com/affiliate-signup/account-details

All sign ups are vetted by our compliance team and as such, after signup, there is a small delay before you are accepted as an Affiliate Window publisher.
